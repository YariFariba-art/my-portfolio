        <h4>
            I am Fariba Yari, born and raised in Afghanistan, with a bachelor's degree in Business. Working in the telecom industry and collaborating with developers ignited my passion for technology. This led me to explore coding, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through SheCodes by working on practical projects. Now, I am eager to contribute to larger projects and gain hands-on experience in real-world applications. Additionally, I am actively learning Python.
